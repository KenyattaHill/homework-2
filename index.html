              Hello, my name is Kenyatta, but I go by Kenny. I currently live in
              Utah, but I was born in AZ. I have 5 boys which only my 2 youngest
              still live with me, (14 and 20). I spent 27 years in the grocery
              retail industry which I currently no longer do. I was in Management
              for 19 of the 27 years and the most rewarding aspect was all of the
              associate’s careers I got to be a part of. I really love inspiring
              others and due to layoffs and a blessing in disguise, I’m finally
              going after my passion. My goal is to get into IT, Programing, or
              Cybersecurity.
            </p>
            <p>
              My top 2 loves are my kids, and our hobbies are video games and action
              movies and secondly, basketball which I play weekly. I’m also a
              certified master diver with about 60 or 70 logged dives, (I haven’t
              caught up my dive log) since late 2016. I’ve been to Hawaii, Honduras,
              and Curacao. I didn’t dive at all in 2019, but I will get back in the
              swing of things in 2020.
